This repository contains supplementary material of the Thesis "Spatio Temporal Forecasting of Events Using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks" as a parcial requisite to fullfill computer engineering course of Universidade de São Paulo, São Carlos. 

**Abstract**: *Observable events in the real world are often formed by a number of distinct factors from
different fields. With the large amount of data available, one of the ways to carry out an analysis
of these events is from textual sensors. A recent example is sensors related to COVID-19 events.
In this case, each sensor is responsible for classifying and monitoring specific events within
a dataset. One method for performing temporal analysis is the prediction of trends involving
the occurrence of events, which can be performed using regression methods, especially with
the use of machine learning for prediction in time series. However, recent studies indicate that
events may also be spatially related, that is, one or more event sensors may be geographically
related. As a solution to such challenges, new algorithms have been proposed to deal with
spatiotemporal prediction. In this sense, a method investigated in this project is the STGCN
(Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks), which represents a set of sensors through
graphs. Thus, this work aims to evaluate the STGCN for spatiotemporal prediction in event
databases. This evaluation explores a set of events extracted from news about COVID-19,
organized in more than 200 sensors (sub-themes). To verify the impact of graph structure and
geographic information, STGCN was compared with the Prophet method, proposed by the
Facebook research team for time series predictions. The work presents as a conclusion the
importance of considering geographic information in the analysis of events, especially in the
spatiotemporal prediction of events. In addition to comparing the models, the project ends up
presenting an open source repository to perform event analysis via STGCN and Prophet in a
simplified way.*
